This Traffic Simulator displays the Red Green Cycle for a single intersection given particular inputs.

## Setup

### Requirements:

- npm
- a web browser

### Steps:

- In an open terminal, in the 415Deliverable3 folder
- navigate to the server folder

  - run “npm install” and then “npm start”.
  - Example:
    ```sh
    $ cd server
    $ npm install
    $ npm start
    ```

- Once the server is active, open a browser to the address “localhost:3000/home.html” to access the webpage.
  From there the user may interact as they wish with the different conditions and input fields to determine specific traffic simulation solutions, as explained in the user model section.
  See [UserModel.md](https://github.com/GauravDeshpande/415Deliverable3/blob/FrontEnd/UserModel.md)

#### Notes:

- Percentages must equal 100 for any given direction
